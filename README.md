# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game implemented as a simple and interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a 3Ã—3 grid where players take turns marking a cell with either X or O. The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

This project helps in understanding basic front-end development concepts, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and game state management.
